# Readme for using Logic with 8 outputs.

There's a couple of different ways to use Logic (or another DAW like Audacity, ProTools, Ableton Live etc) with multiple speakers. One way is to have track sent directly to each output which can sound cool. You can also use special surround (or ambisonic) panners to move sounds around a 3d space.

 - Logic includes panners for 5.1 surround which is what I've used in the example. Just make sure the outputs are correctly mapped to right speakers! [Here's the relevant part of Logic's manual.](https://help.apple.com/logicpro/mac/9.1.6/en/logicpro/usermanual/index.html#chapter=39%26section=0%26tasks=true)
 - For 3D Ambisonics, you'll need an Audio Unit (AU) plugin [Daniel Courville's B2X suite](http://www.radio.uqam.ca/ambisonic/b2x.html) seems to work, and is free! woo!
