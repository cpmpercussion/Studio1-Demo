# Readme for Reaper Examples

For doing "DAW" style production in ambisonics the best choice for the moment is [Reaper - a low-cost DAW](http://www.reaper.fm). The reason is that Reaper is one of the only DAWs that is flexible enough to work with the weird multi-channel formats you need to make ambisonics work (Logic in particular is not happy in 3D surround..).

You'll also need some special plugins for panning sounds into a virtual 3D soundfield and a plugin to decode the ambisonic mix to the loudspeakers in Studio 1. [WigWare is a great (free)](http://www.brucewiggins.co.uk/?page_id=78) option - download the 1st Order decoders, panners and reverb.

Once you've got Reaper and Wigware installed - check out the example file or Bruce Wiggins' [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsoIqW5WJhk) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuJsS_YpC2A) explaining how to use his plugins in Reaper.

One good way to produce ambisonic tracks might be to compose some tracks in whatever software (Logic, Ableton, Pd) and then export them into Reaper to mix into 3d sound and playback in Studio 1. Then you can export the B-Format stems to play them back in any ambisonic setup!
